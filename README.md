# hello-world
my very first repository!

David here. Coding is something I attempted towards the end of my time in college and I struggled and walked away from it. I thought about applying myself to it from time to time as I felt it the internet of things will be the force driving our economy for years to come and it would give me the chance to develop and provide for my family. Time passed and I went another route...but am back and find freecodecamp to be an opportunity to really try this out.
